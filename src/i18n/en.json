    "description": "Laurence Philomene is a photographer based in Montreal, Canada. Laurence makes colourful work that centres queer and trans experiences, often through long-form and autobiographical projects.\nLaurence's work is informed by their lived experiences as a chronically ill, non-binary transgender artist coming of age amid the rise of social media. Through high-saturated, cinematic and caring images, their work celebrates marginalized existences, and studies identity as a space in constant flux.\nLaurence aims to work in collaboration with every person they photograph - creating striking, intimate portraits that celebrate the beauty in every human being. Instantly recognizable by their signature use of colour and daylight, Laurence's photographs act as a love letter to their community."

    "paragraph1": "Les Essentiels (the Essentials) is an installation of eight interactive sculptures that present, via an online platform. These portraits celebrate the neighbourhood's residents. They act to mitigate the other's fear in the context of the COVID pandemic while showcasing the diversity of the community and the locals who live there.",
    "paragraph2": "These eight colourful sculptures offer visitors eight photographic portraits and anecdotes of the life of these essential workers. The portraits are intended to represent the diversity of the neighbourhood and celebrate the importance of all kinds of essential workers during the pandemic. Colourful and playful, this installation invites the public to interact with the artwork and to discover a new side of the area creatively. ",
    "paragraph3": "For Laurence, this project is a way to show her gratitude and celebrate her own story with Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension neighbourhood, a place she calls home. Laurence wishes to thank and elevate the people who give its authenticity to a proud multicultural borough mainly inhabited by the working class.  ",
    "paragraph4": "Our multidisciplinary team is composed by the photographer Laurence Philomene and the creative agency MASSIVart. Laurence Philomène's role was to select individuals, realized photographic portraits and interviews. Decisions related to sculpture design and the project's overall aesthetics have been taken jointly between MASSIVart and Laurence Philomène to create a truly collaborative work. MASSIVart is in charge of the project management, production and web component."
